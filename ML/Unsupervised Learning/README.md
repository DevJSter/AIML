## What is unsupervised learning?
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

## Common Unsupervised Learning Approaches

Unsupervised learning models serve three primary tasks: clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction. The following outlines each learning method and highlights common algorithms and approaches for their effective implementation.

## Clustering

Clustering is a data mining technique that groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. Clustering algorithms process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information. Clustering algorithms can be categorized into exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic types.

### Exclusive and Overlapping Clustering

**Exclusive clustering** involves grouping data points into only one cluster, also known as "hard" clustering. The K-means clustering algorithm is an example of exclusive clustering.

* K-means clustering: Data points are assigned to K groups, where K represents the number of clusters based on the distance from each group’s centroid. The data points closest to a given centroid will be clustered under the same category. K-means clustering is commonly used in market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation, and image compression.

**Overlapping clusters** differ from exclusive clustering as they allow data points to belong to multiple clusters with separate degrees of membership. "Soft" or fuzzy k-means clustering is an example of overlapping clustering.

### Hierarchical Clustering

**Hierarchical clustering**, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), is an unsupervised clustering algorithm categorized as agglomerative or divisive.

#### Agglomerative Clustering

Agglomerative clustering is considered a "bottoms-up approach." Data points are initially isolated as separate groupings and are then iteratively merged based on similarity until one cluster is achieved. Four commonly used methods to measure similarity are:

* Ward’s linkage: Defines the distance between two clusters by the increase in the sum of squared after the clusters are merged.
* Average linkage: Defined by the mean distance between two points in each cluster.
* Complete (or maximum) linkage: Defined by the maximum distance between two points in each cluster.
* Single (or minimum) linkage: Defined by the minimum distance between two points in each cluster.

Euclidean distance is the most common metric used to calculate these distances, although other metrics, such as Manhattan distance, are also cited in clustering literature.

#### Divisive Clustering

Divisive clustering, the opposite of agglomerative clustering, takes a "top-down" approach. In this case, a single data cluster is divided based on the differences between data points. While divisive clustering is not commonly used, it is worth noting in the context of hierarchical clustering. These clustering processes are usually visualized using a dendrogram, a tree-like diagram documenting the merging or splitting of data points at each iteration.

## Probabilistic Clustering
Probabilistic clustering is an unsupervised technique addressing density estimation or "soft" clustering problems. Data points are clustered based on the likelihood that they belong to a particular distribution. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) stands out as one of the most commonly used probabilistic clustering methods.

## Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
Gaussian Mixture Models fall under the category of mixture models, composed of an unspecified number of probability distribution functions. GMMs primarily determine which Gaussian (normal) probability distribution a given data point belongs to. In GMMs, the mean and variance are unknown, leading to the assumption of a latent (hidden) variable for appropriate data point clustering. While not mandatory, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly used to estimate assignment probabilities for a given data point to a specific data cluster.

## Association Rules

Association rules are rule-based methods for identifying relationships between variables in a dataset. These methods are frequently employed for market basket analysis, aiding businesses in understanding relationships between different products for improved cross-selling strategies and recommendation engines.

## Apriori Algorithms

Apriori algorithms, popularized through market basket analyses, play a crucial role in various recommendation engines. They identify frequent itemsets within transactional datasets to gauge the likelihood of consuming a product given the consumption of another product. The Apriori algorithm uses a hash tree to count itemsets, navigating through the dataset in a breadth-first manner.

## Dimensionality Reduction

While more data generally improves accuracy, it can impact machine learning algorithm performance and visualization. Dimensionality reduction addresses high-dimensional datasets by reducing the number of features while preserving data integrity.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that reduces redundancies and compresses datasets through feature extraction. It uses a linear transformation to create "principal components," with each subsequent component orthogonal to the prior ones, capturing the maximum variance in the data.

## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Singular Value Decomposition factorizes a matrix into three low-rank matrices (A = USVT), where U and V are orthogonal matrices, and S is a diagonal matrix representing singular values. Similar to PCA, SVD is used to reduce noise and compress data, such as image files.

## Autoencoders

Autoencoders utilize neural networks to compress data and recreate a new representation. The hidden layer acts as a bottleneck, compressing the input layer before reconstructing within the output layer. The encoding stage moves from the input layer to the hidden layer, while the decoding stage goes from the hidden layer to the output layer.

# Unsupervised vs. Supervised vs. Semi-Supervised Learning

Unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning are distinct approaches in machine learning, each with its own set of characteristics and applications.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms operate without labeled data. They explore data to identify patterns, relationships, or structures without explicit guidance. While unsupervised learning offers flexibility and is effective in various scenarios, its output may lack clear interpretation due to the absence of predefined labels.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms, in contrast, rely on labeled data to predict future outcomes or assign data to specific categories. This approach often yields more accurate results compared to unsupervised learning. However, it requires upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. Common techniques include linear regression, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, KNN algorithm, and random forest.

## Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning occurs when only part of the input data is labeled. This approach bridges the gap between unsupervised and supervised learning, offering a compromise in scenarios where labeling the entire dataset is time-consuming or costly. It leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to make predictions.
